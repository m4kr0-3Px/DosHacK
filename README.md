# DosHacK
 This tool was created to measure the resilience of websites to a dos attack.<br>
 The purpose of this tool is to test the dos attack. This tool receives one ip address and one port by the user. This received data is used to connect to the victim site and sends packets there using threading.<br><br>  This tool tries to connect to the system in question with the ip address and port it receives from you in the background. If it does not face any firewall or port closure, it starts to send packets for the dos attack test by providing a socket connection to the relevant place.
